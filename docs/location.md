> **GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS TEMPLATE**
> 
> **Remove this set of instructions before publishing this deliverable.**
>
> **Usage guidelines**

> 1. Read the text at the beginning of each section for guidance for additional information for completing this document.  Remove these diretions before publication.
> 1. Ensure to keep the same format for headers and content.  If there is a need to add a new section, please insert new ones sparingly and refresh the content table, as needed.  Rather than add new top level headings, it's preferable to add a subsection within one of the standard headings to maintain a standard flow.
> 1. Always keep a line break after headers. 
> 1. *Italicized text* is standard boilerplate text for all released specifications and should remain in the document.
> 1. Remove this section before publication.

> **General style**
>
> 1. Position and language of the document should read like a requirements specification document.
> 1. Internal accounting of the working group is not appropriate to include in this document (e.g. cut-paste of the charter, coordination across WGs, timelines, milestones, reviews conducted, and other items not germane to a specification).  These items should be maintained by the WG separately.
> 1. Summarizing charter language to help frame certain sections of the specification such as the Objectives, Introduction, and Scope Sections is appropriate.  Reframe the wording keeping in mind the target audience is the ITC.
> 1. The primary audience for this document is the BSC Implementation TC (ITC).  If there is additional information helpful to convey to the DFTC Directors and/or the ITC, please attach separately in memorandum form.
> 1. Please don't refer to implementation specifics in this requirements specfication.  These details will be outlined by the ITC in a subsequent activity.
>     * Refer to the term blockchain as a general loose reference.  
>     * References to APIs is an implementation detail that is not germane to this specification.
>      * Noting JSON as being the stored on the blockchain is another example of an implementation detail that is NOT germane to this specification.

### Work-in-progress / open items

> **Remove this entire section, including the section header, before publishing this deliverable.**
> Resolve all open issues prior to publishing this document.  Coordinate with other Working Groups as needed.  Raise questionables with DFTC Directors as it is possible items could be directed to the "out of scope" section of this document.

1. the nesting is only 2 levels deep in the original published Location Component specification and this OAS spec.  Need to reconcile/clarify the verbiage here vs. the specs.
1. there is a special qualifier called "multiple".  It is unclear how this is used in relation to the nesting that is noted.  For example -- multiple at level 2 does not allow for sub-postions at level 3 in this structure -- but maybe it should not.
1. warehouse zone, bin, shelf in in the text above  (that was in the original document) and it is in the OAS spec -- but there are no requirments definition in the published spec.  Need to reconcile all this to ensure the data elements are properly defined, reviewed, and published.  Suggests there might be an unpublished revision of location out there somewhere with this detail.
1. it seems like we need to clarify (1) a bin or shelf or row or sector cannot stand lone.  It's container such as the address of the warehouse would always apply.  And (2) a location can have multiple references.  It can have a street address and/or a geocode and/or others.
1. provide specific detail on the Meta/ID field and how it is to be populated and what the intention here is for Location.  Is this an implementation specific detail to defer to the ITC??

### Abstract

*BSC Data Format Technical Committee and its Working Groups develop and publish requirements specifications for solving specific transportation related business problems using blockchain technology.  This specification captures data requirements -- data element names, relationships between elements, types, and rules such as valid values, enumerated lists, and required vs. optional values.*

**Add the text from June....making it up for now:**  *Two types of specifications are published.  Component specications describe reusable building blocks and do not standalone.  These building blocks are referenced within Document specifications.  Document specifications are published in support of a specific business process.*

*Document specifications will be used as a key input by the BSC Implementation Technical Committee (ITC) to produce specific implementaiton level technical guidance for how data shall be written to and retrieved from blockchain.  It is this ITC end-deliverable that is the primary consumable artifact by BSC membership and industry at large.*

### Objective

> **Remove this text before publishing this deliverable.**
> Clearly state the objective of the specification and what the specification is trying to
achieve

Define a **Location Component specification** to provide a common structure to represent where an activity happens or where someone or something is located.  This construct is fundamental to transportation and logistics operations.  It is also fundamental to supporting business operations such as account management, pricing, and billing.  The structure can represent multiple, necessary forms of geographic identification.

### Introduction

> **Remove this text before publishing this deliverable.**
> Provide a short background description.  Include some measure of general usage context if it is helpful to aide understanding.

The Location Component is a data structure used whenever a geographic location needs to be represented within a ***host Document*** such one that supports shipment tracking, invoicing, etc.  The Location Component, as a self-contained structure, contains all the information needed to determine a geographic location.

The Location Component is used to define the location of any type of object or entity regardless of whether it is fixed (e.g. a building, port, rail station, etc) or mobile (e.g. a vehicle or shipping container, etc.).

![figure2](location-figure2.png)

A Location Component is a data structure that is always embedded a host Document.  In other words, a Location Component can never exist in isolation on the blockchain. This is because the other data structure(s) define the accompanying data depending on the purpose of the Location Component. 

Examples:
-	Track the location of a shipping container
-	Record the destination address of a shipment
-	Record the billing address of a customer for a shipment
-	Dispatch a driver to a location

### Scope

> **Remove this text before publishing this deliverable.**
> Clearly delineate the boundary lines drawn for what is included in the specification and what is excluded.  The out of scope section is optional and should be removed if it does not apply or provide useful clarity.

-	Identify where an item is or has been within a journey 
-	Identify where an item is planned to be within an itinerary
-	Transportation and logistics use cases involving tracking and tracing.  As such airline, railway, roadway, ocean, and fixed warehousing and related custodial operations  such as pickup, delivery, drayage, customs, etc. are in scope.
-	Identify standard data elements & attributes known across multiple industries to form a starting data structure with the ability to add custom and/or unique Position attributes that provide greater position accuracy.

#### Out of scope:

-	Consistent with the generalized nature of a Component Specification, the context for how this specification is used is not covered.  This will be provided in the BSC Document specification where this component is utilized.

### Glossary

#### Intentions

> **Remove this text before publishing this deliverable.**
> It is very imortant to capture the intention and rationale for "why" the requirements are formulated the way they are in the "requirements" section.  Include this detail in this section.

A location may have a nested relationship with aliases or alternate references for the same location.  When the position array contains more than 1 structure, each structure is meant to represent the same location but using a different method such as latitude/longitude, postal address etc.

The intention of supporting multiple methods is to: a) Make the Location Component suitable for multiple use cases b) Support the expansion of the Location Component specification in a backwards-compatible way in the future

By doing so, the desire is to improve the adoption rates of this Specification. For example, the rail industry has an industry-specific method of specifying locations called the SPLC. Third parties may not have the ability to interpret this data so railway operators publishing locations in SPLC formats have the ability to publish a second more widely-known method such as latitude/longitude.

Position structure can contain nested structures including optional nested structures to handle scenarios where a method for specifying a location may have instances where a detailed location is needed and others where a detailed location description is not needed (or possible). For example, a location at a Warehouse would have as the root location structure (the root implements Position) specifying the postal address of the warehouse. Within that structure could be nested a warehouse zone identifying an area that the warehouse is sub-divided into. And within the Warehouse Zone structure could be nested a bin or shelf that might identify the specific location needed for a warehouse picker to locate an item
