# How to follow this pattern.

1. Clone docs/location.md to whatever.
1. Clone location.html to whaever.  Wtthin this file change this line to match #1<br>
  (yes, replace .md shown in #1 with .html)<br>
  $('#doc').load("docs/location.html");<br>
1. Point browser to your cloned version of https://redblue36.github.io/DataFormatDemoSwaggerUI/location.html to view the page.

As an aside, Stoplight Studio works pretty well to author the OAS and .md markdown.
